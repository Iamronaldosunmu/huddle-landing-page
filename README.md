## Overview
I found the challenge on frontendmentor.io a little while after completing some courses on html and css.
I was able to successfuly build the website as I was told to.
The site is being hosted using github pages.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I built the site by first identifying the different components on the website and then I started putting them together after developing each component. 
I did encounter some challenges- I had to find a way to change the background based on the screen size. Knowing what I know know, it would have been way better to first learn SASS then use the if statements to sort that
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflo
### What I learned

I solidified my understanding of html and css learnt how to manipulate css in complex situations.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
- Right now I am learning UI/UX design to give that extra aesthetic to my front end projects.

### Useful resources

- [Ultimate HTML and CSS mastery](https://www.codewithmosh.com) - This is an amazing course which helped me learn HTML and CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
